/*
 *  Your name is Atticus Madden.
    You currently work for Code Mission Possible - A company who works on creating software solutions for clean energy.

    You are the SCRUM Manager for 3 different projects (Electric Missiles, Soap Free Washers, and Air Computers)
    Open Electric Missiles
    Add a new task "Initialize super algorithm to detonate at warp speed". Assign the task to Jeff Goldblum.
    Add a comment to the task "Avoid civilians Jeff!"
    Move the existing task of "Curve the metal to make a cylindrical shape" to the 'Doing' column.
    This task has the existing comments of "Not cylindrical enough" - by Jeff,
    and "What's a cylinder" by Atticus Madden.  
    Reply to Jeff's comment and say "How about you do it jeff",
    and re-assign the task from yourself to Jeff.
    Add a new column called "Abandoned"
    Move an existing task "Make impossible burger possible" which doesn't really relate to the project purpose to "Abandoned"
    Now print the scrum board to a txt file.... make it pretty.
